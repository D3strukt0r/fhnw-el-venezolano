    <h1>Our Products/Our Idea</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>Our idea is to serve fresh food and beverages to the customer and so they explore the country
        of Venezuela. The purpose of the food region is, that you will find Venezuelan dishes very
        rarely. So, we want to change that in Basel. But in our modern time there is one little but
        strong problem. The internet in connection with smartphones and social media. Often, we see
        people gather together for a dinner, but they don’t talk to each other. They stare at their
        smartphone and share the experience with the world rather to enjoy the stay. That’s very a
        shame and unsocial. But for this, we have a solution. How, you may ask? Digitalization is very
        common today and also very important to nowadays lifestyle. Because of that, we added a
        built-in touchscreen in each table. In this way, the people can order the food, see the status,
        play minigames, enjoy the food and pay with the touchscreen all together. Therefore, you can
        put away the phone and concentrate on a delicious trip of Venezuelan dishes and experience it
        in a whole new level which no other restaurant would do.</p>
    <br />
    <p>We will show you an example of one of our menu options that you can choose with the traditional
        order.</p>
